# Predicting-Car-Prices

My newest project I am working on is a regression model to predict local car prices. 

Since I am looking to purchase my first car soon I would like to know if I'm getting a good deal or paying too much. In order to help make my decision I will be creating a web scraper to collect data from car selling websites such as make, model, year, mileage, and price, etc. Using R and python I will create multiple different models to try to predict the most accurate price, then when new cars are listed I will use the model to get my price prediction and compare it to the actual price to judge how good of a deal I'm getting.

I will be posting my coding progress in this repository so stay tuned!
